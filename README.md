This project focuses on designing a web infrastructure and understanding various components involved in hosting a website. The goal is to explain the different elements, their roles, and related concepts without relying on external resources.

## Concepts

To successfully complete this project, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

- Network basics: Understanding the fundamentals of networking protocols, IP addresses, and communication between devices.
- Server: Knowing what a server is and its role in handling requests and delivering responses over a network.
- Web Server: Understanding the purpose of a web server in handling HTTP requests and serving web content.
- DNS: Learning about the Domain Name System and how it translates domain names into IP addresses.
- Load Balancer: Knowing the concept of load balancing to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
- Monitoring: Understanding the importance of monitoring system performance and resources to ensure smooth operation.

## Resources

To gain the necessary knowledge, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- Network basics concept page
- Server concept page
- Web server concept page
- DNS concept page
- Load balancer concept page
- Monitoring concept page
- What is a database?
- What's the difference between a web server and an app server?
- DNS record types
- Single point of failure
- How to avoid downtime when deploying new code
- High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)
- What is HTTPS?
- What is a firewall?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Create a diagram depicting the web stack built during the sysadmin/devops track projects.
- Explain the purpose and functionality of each component within the web stack.
- Describe the concept of system redundancy to ensure high availability.
- Understand key acronyms related to web infrastructure, such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and SPOF (Single Point of Failure).
- Whiteboard each task to demonstrate your understanding in front of a mentor, staff member, or fellow student.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this project, you must fulfill the following requirements:

- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Capture a picture or screenshot of your whiteboard diagram for each task.
- Upload the screenshots to an image hosting service.
- Insert the image link into the answer file for each task.
- Push your answer file to GitHub and provide the GitHub file link.
- Be prepared to whiteboard each task, demonstrating your understanding without relying on computers or notes.
- Focus on the specific requirements mentioned in each task.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity, unless explicitly asked to provide additional details.

Remember, the purpose of this project is to showcase your comprehension of web infrastructure design, so focus on meeting the stated requirements and demonstrating your understanding effectively.
